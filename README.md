CORS (cross-origin sharing standard) is a mechanism who add additional HTTP header, for give access on a distant resource of the website who make a request. When this mechanism don't allow all distant sites, web browser return error when app make a request on distant API. API server don't allow all websites so you can have error if you run standard browsers.

/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --user-data-dir="/tmp/chrome_dev_session" --disable-web-security
```
